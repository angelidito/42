# FdF - Wireframe Render

This is a wireframe render project that creates a 3D representation of a map of points, also known as a "wireframe". The project was developed as part of the curriculum at 42 School of Programming.

## Requirements

- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [MLX library](https://github.com/abouvier/minilibx)

## Compiling and Running

Clone this repository to your local machine and run the following commands in your terminal:
>
	make
	./fdf <map_file>

Replace `[map_file]` with the path to a valid map file. A few sample maps are provided in the `test_maps/` directory.

## Features

- 3D representation of a wireframe map
- User interface with interactive controls
- Multiple color schemes to choose from

## Usage:
* ```Arrow keys```: translate map.
* ```A``` and ```D```: rotate map.
* ```W``` and ```S```: tilt map.
* ```R``` and ```F```: increase/decrease elevation.
* ```,``` and ```.```: change views (net/dots/both).
* ```+```, ```-``` and ```mouse wheel```: zoom in/out.
* ```Q``` and ```ESC```: quit program.
