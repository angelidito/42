# libft - My Personal C Library

Welcome to my personal implementation of various standard C library functions!  
This library, known as `libft`, is a project from the curriculum at 42 and is the first step towards students building their own implementations of common functions for later projects.

## What is libft?
`libft` is a personal implementation of various standard C library functions, including functions for string manipulation, memory management, and conversions. The library is written in C and is built to be used with future projects at 42. 

## Getting Started
To get started with using `libft`, simply ~~download the `code` directory~~ make **your own libft** and include the header file `libft.h` in your project. You can then call any of the implemented functions by linking against the `libft` library.
